- Implement an adaptive interpolation factor
- Move utility functions to a separate module
- Implement different feature extraction methods
- Implement dynamic resizing
- Shift some calculations to tensorflow (or some other optimized module, preferably using CUDA)
- Implement image segmentation
- Add a way to save instances of the model, and then compare these against the current frame
-     if detection fails
- Experiment with RNNs making use of the same features
- Reinforcement learning?
